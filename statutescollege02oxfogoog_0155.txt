1110 Corpus Christi Colleye, Orford. ’

Lord Bishop aforesaid, as Visitor ol your said Colloge, and
according to the trust reposed in me by your ious Founder,
alter having maturely wcighed and considered this your sta·
tute, with the reasons given by both parties in their Appeal
before me. have hero sent you my determination of the case: l
conceive your Founder has allowed his Fellows to be absent
every year a set and determinate time, beyond which he does
not permit thern to be absent. But, upon second thoughts, in
the same chapter he has enlarged his first confinement pro-
vided they could lay just claim to any of the causes mentioned
in this paragraph, ⁴‘ non prohibemus” &a Among several causes
therein mentioned, there is “ Promotionis causa,'’ on which only
this doubt and Appeal was made. Now my opinion is that
your Founder, by this extraordinary grace and favour, did
really design to grant your Fellows sufficient time of absence
to get preterment. And in your Founder's days, half a year
yearly with the six months “in obsequium Regis aut Episcopi’'
might probably be sufficient for that end. But the times are
now so lar altered that ’tis highly im robable that any one can
get preferment in the time prescribed by this statute, let him
be in never so good and likely a post or· service. ‘lherefore l
do hereby declare and determine that, according to your Foun·
der’s mind and intention (which he would have followed as
well as his letter and ammatioal sense), your Fellows may
have their time enlarg “ Promotionis causa.'’ But least this
determination should in process of time be abused and ex-
tended beyond my meaning, I order and direct these limita·
tions to be always observed. Fiat, no one shall have above
six months gr‘anted at a time,but it may be renewed as often
(durante causa) as the President and major part of the seven
senior Fellows think fit. Secondly, none but Fellows who are
Masters ofArts and out of their Regoncy ad placitum, sball be
ellitstill?,lttltttlrl'llttlt·nllt‘llnlthhl
shall declare to the President and seven Seniors what his em·
ployment or service is, and they shall judgo if it be a credit-
able and profitable way to get relerment by; but the Fellow
so desiring time shall swear to tie truth of brs cause as this sta-
tute provides in other cases. Fourthly‚ if any Fellow that
bears any office in tho Colle e shall desire to be absent by
virtue of this determination, shall first quit his office before
it be granted him. Fistbly, upon tbis new extraordinary time
there shall not be absent above three or four Fellows at one
time. Sixthly, if at any time there shall not be actual Fellows
enough in town to bear all the offices of the Collega, the Pre-

sident may and shall summon home any one, or as many as are η

wanted to bear the Colle offices: and if any one so sum-
moned homo neglect or reffise to return home in three months ἓ
