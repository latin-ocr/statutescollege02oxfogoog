An Iniunction of tlte Ripa sevam Futltcr in God Beujomin,
Lord Bisbop of Wnchestcr‚ aad Visitor of tlte Colleyc ο] Corpus
Christi in tlte University of Osford, to dispersae citt tlte resi-
deucc of the Mater-&notari of tte said Colleye [1755]

Benjamiu, by divine permission‚ Bishop of winchester, to the
Reverend the President and senior Fellows of Corpus Christi
Collega in Oxford sendcth greeting. Whereas Georgo Beaver.
Charles Reeks, William Osmplin, Joseph Wells, Richard
Skinner, Thomas Hurst‚ and Edward Simone, Masters of Arte,
and Scholars of your Collcge, have represented to me, as
Visitor of tbe said Collega the following particulare—That the
succession to Fellowship in the said College is become exceed-

ol the¹ Disciple-Masters, which at the time of the foundation ol
the said College was a sufficient maintenance, is now, by the
decresse of the value of money aud other circumstances of the

resent age, become by no means sufficient lor that purpose-
pltat the expense of residing in the University so constantly
as the said Petitioners are by the statutes ol the said Collega
’ required to do is greater than they, or others in their station,
are usually able to bear; the said residence depriving them at
the same time of the opportunit- of relieving their circum·
stances and sarving God and nranhind by the exercise of the
clerical function3 their present confinemeut not permittin
them to offer themselves lor the supply of curacies which
require their residence—That it seems evident the Founder
did notin the least foresee the present slowness of succession
iu his College, nor the above-mentioned inconveniences and
bardships. Because the most particular directions laid down
in the statute for the succession of Disci uli to Fellowships
relate to, and suppose, the succession of itachelors of Arte,
