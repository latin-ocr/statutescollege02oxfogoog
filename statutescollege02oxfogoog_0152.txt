Postscript.

, Asfor 1110 cause alledged out of tbe statute “ De restituet
ornatu,’' though I confess it to be foreign to the business ro·
perly and principally referred unto me, yet I did thinl it
worth the stepping a little out 01 my way to give you m
sense 01 your Founder's intention and meaning in it, which
was no doubt to forbid the wearing 01 hair 01 011 exorbitant
length, whether it were their own hair or a perriwig‚ and he
would no doubt have forbid the latter b neme much more
than the former, had it then been in fashiom as now it is,
because thereby the Cler do much more συσχηματίζειν
ἑαυτοὺς τῷ αἰῶνι τούτῳ, 00 St. aul calls it, conform themselves
to the world, and the extravagant fashions of the world, by
assimilatin themselves 10Ι the Laity (which your Founder
would not have thern to do) than by wearing too long 1101101
1110110110, though he would not have them 10 do that neither.
And certain it is that where the lesser transgression of 0 law
is forbidden, then the greater transgression 01 the 0011101011
must be understood 10 be forbidden also. Lay your hands
therefore upon your hearts, and seriourly consider what ou
010 10 do in this particular. Ego animam meam liberavi. rlnd
yet 1 am not so severe as to enjoin those that wear perriwigs·
presently 10 0001 them off, before their own hair is grown to a
decent length3 or to forbid those 11101 are aged 01 sickly 10
wear a border 01 bair witha black cap, and what they will
under it 10 keep their beads and their necks 1101111,οο the
border of the 11011 be not (to use the words of the Founder)
“ in 00110 101 in fronte nimis protensa ;” with which limitation,
1 declare the wearing 01 such 0 border of hair to be no breach

01 this statute.
